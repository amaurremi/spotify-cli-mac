Jellyfish Jones has got no bones but if he did where would he go?  
he would 
 
tap dance live on a TV show  get in a boat and row row row 
jump high up on a trampoline  but he's stuck in the sea 
 
try to ride a mechanical bull  reach the pedals on a bicycle 
win the big basketball game  but he can't and that is a shame 
 
sign up to learn how to belly dance  get fitted for some jelly fish pants 
bowl a strike at the bowling lanes  but he's under the waves 
hula hoop until he's blue in the face  run run run from place to place 
climb and jump and stomp around  but he's stuck in the sound 
fly down a hill on roller skates  slide on the ice in a figure eight 
sky dive from five thousand feet  but he's stuck in the deep
