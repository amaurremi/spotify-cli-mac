[1mEMOTIONAL ROBOT [0m
 
   let me tell you a story 'bout a robot with a heart 
Bm      
     tried to be a calculator but he just didn't fit the part 
tried algorithyms trigonometry and other complex math 
but all those operations didn't make him cry or laugh 
   his friends all wanted him to come out and play 
                 Bm  
they loved finding prime numbers and assembling microwaves 
but this robot thought that that sameness was lame 
he did not want to join in thier mechanical games 'cause 
 
   he's just an emotional robot        with feelings on his mind 
D    A                G        A D                                   Bm A   G    A   D 
   a sentimental cyborg        he gets rusty when he cry cry cry cry cries 
                      Bm                           G                          
rusty when he cries rusty when he cries  
rusty when he cries  
 
nobody understood that robots could feel sad 
     Bm  
so nobody answered his personal ad it read 
robot seeking robot to share sunsets on the beach 
will he always be alone is love just out of reach?
