[1mTHE SOFTEST GUITAR ON THE MOON [0m
 
lonely little guitar way up there in space stuck on the surface of the moon 
how did he get there? how does he sound? who will pluck out his tune? 
 
we miss him we love him we hope heâ€™ll be comng home soon 
the melody that he plays is so small 
 
'cause he's the softest guitar on the moon someone left him out in orbit 
he strums and hums and waits forever if you ever get there let him know  
 
covered all up with dust lying on a rock cold but ready to play 
waiting by a crater waiting until later staring off into space 
 
we miss him we love him we hope heâ€™ll be comng home soon 
the melody that he plays is so small 
 
'cause he's the softest guitar on the moon someone left him out in orbit 
he strums and hums and waits forever if you ever get there let him know  
if you ever get there let him know  
if you ever get there let him know  
that we love him so  
that we love him so
