    now that the day is done and we have run our races 
    it's time to mellow out and stare out into spaces 
     of all the babies you've got the cutest of all faces 
    you yawn I yawn because baby yawns are contagious

  groggy baby        groggy baby     you can barely hold up your head

  groggy baby        groggy baby     how 'bout maybe you head to bed? 
 
    you're so relaxed seems like your bones are made of jell-o 
    that's what it's like when a baby gets too mellow 
    the sunset lights your eyes purple orange and yellow 
    you burrow deep into a soft and fluffy pillow

    day was long your thoughts are feeling cloggy 
    let me change your nappy the one you've got is soggy 
    even our memories of today are growing foggy 
    the night outside makes you small and hot and groggy
