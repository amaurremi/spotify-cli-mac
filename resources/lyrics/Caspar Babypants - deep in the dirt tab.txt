[1mDEEP IN THE DIRT [0m
 
deep in the dirt is a mole so brown  
digging up and digging down 
deep in the dirt there's a maze of roots 
some go to trees and the trees grow fruit 
deep in the dirt there's a growing power comin' up through a tiny flower 
 
deep in the middle of the dirt in the middle of the dirt  
in the middle of the world 
 
deep in the dirt there are tiny stones  
millions of mushrooms millions of bones 
deep in the dirt there's a bunch of ants 
hollow out a home underneath the plants 
deep in the dirt grows a vegetable day after day 'till they're ready to pull

deep in the dirt there's a molecule part  
born in the center of a distant star 
deep in the tubes of a volcano 
the dirt gets hot and it wants to flow 
deep in the dirt is the summers heat and the frozen winter so frosty 
 
deep in the dirt is where I go
