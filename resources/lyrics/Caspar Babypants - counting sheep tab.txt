[1mCOUNTING SHEEP [0m
 
one sheep in a meadow two sheep feeling mellow 
three sheep reclining still in the twilight there by the pool 
four sheep feeling dreamy five sheep take it easy 
six sheep sitting in a shady spot oh so cool 
 
when you feel lousy droopy and drousy 
count on counting some sheep in your head 
when you feel bleary ragged and weary  
lay back and think of sheep sleeping instead 
 
seven sheep in meditation eight sheep on a vacation 
nine sheep spend a saturday sleeping in late 
ten sheep are relaxing eleven sheep are slacking 
twelve sheep take a deep breath to oxegenate
