rhinosorus can stomp his feet and make a booming sound 
chimpanzee can boogie side to side and upside down 
falmingo makes the scene in a pair of bright pink pants 
but we all know that hippo is the queen of the dance 
 
that giraffe is always last to leave the discoteque 
a billion bugs are spinning like a cloud of groovy specks 
elephant can twirl and trumpet music from her snout 
but when the spotlight swings I think you know who's singled out  
    here comes the rising sun but the party lights are on 
the night is fading out we see the coming of the dawn 
all the tired animals are sleeping on the lawn 
but there is one still dancing and I think you know which one
