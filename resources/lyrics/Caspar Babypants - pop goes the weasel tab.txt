[1mPOP GOES THE WEASEL [0m
 
weasel wrote a really good song he wrote it with an ea - gle 
they formed a band and the band was called pop goes the weasel 
they played and sang about a goofy bird it was blues for a sea - gull 
they made it swing and they made it big pop goes the weasel 
 
now they're on the radio the DJ drops the needle 
play that record again and again pop goes the weasel 
 
they had a fancy life they had a fancy car their butler was a bea - gle 
swimming pools and movie stars pop goes the weasel 
 
now they need a second song to keep up with the Beatles 
are one hit wonders all they are? pop goes the weasel 
 
 
they could not write any more songs to play for all the people 
people soon forgot about them pop goes the weasel 
 
now they're playin' for a penny on London road but busking is ille - gal 
that's the way the money goes  
pop goes the weasel (x3)
