[1mTWIST AND POUT [0m
 
when a baby feels super sad but still wants to twist 
I got a sad little dance that will grant that twisted wish 
let your legs go loose and let your emotions out 
stick out your lip swivel your hip twist and pout 
 
time for bed but the twist party rages on 
emotionally fragile and twistin' 'till the break of dawn 
cryin' and dancin' is what this is all about 
stick out your lip swivel your hip twist and pout (2) 
  
any other baby would think about taking a nap 
any other baby would find a bed and collapse     
even though baby is crying it's poor eyes out  
it can still do the twist and pout 
 
 
it's been a long (long) long (long) time since you started the day 
tears on your dancing shoes are stainin' the suede 
blow you runny nose cry and scream and shout  
stick out your lip swivel your hip twist and pout (2) 
stick out your lip swivel your hip
