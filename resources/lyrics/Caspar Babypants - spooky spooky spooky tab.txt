down the lane the children say the house with all the broken panes 
is full of ghostsly spiders and their webs 
watch your front and watch your back that house down on that cul de sac 
will try to put bad dreams inside your head 
ring the doorbell ding dong ding such a chill a thriling thing 
is there anybody home at all? 
find a tree to hide behind watch the door and squint your eyes 
a shadow in the window ten feet tall 
 
spooky spooky spooky eerie eerie eerie 
night time is so spooky daytime is so cheery 
spooky spooky spooky eerie eerie eerie 
night time is so spooky daytime is so cheery yeah 
 
in the woods the children tell a story of a wishing well 
so deep that even light cannot escape 
don't go near to feed the fish or even just to make a wish  
for if you hear an echo it's too late 
stagnant water moldy air that phantom fish that's living there  
is hoping that a child will fall in 
so throw a pebble throw a stone then run away fast back home  
and wish upon a shooting star instead
