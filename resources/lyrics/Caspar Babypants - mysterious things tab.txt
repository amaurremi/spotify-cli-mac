mysterious things are marching around uh huh uh huh 
marching up and marching down uh huh uh huh 
some in the front some in the rear some are solid some are clear 
marching marching all around the town (wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa) 
 
mysterious things are dancing around uh huh uh huh 
dancing up and dancing down uh huh uh huh  
twist and shout twist and crawl one has a head like a disco ball 
dancing dancing all around the town (wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa) 
 
mysterious things are stomping around uh huh uh huh 
stomping up and stomping down uh huh uh huh 
hundreds of feet out for a walk boom boom boom it's an aftershock 
stomping stomping all around the town (wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa) 
 
mysterious things are creeping around uh huh uh huh 
creeping up and creeping down uh huh uh huh 
they fill me with joy they fill me with fear the baby one lives in the bigger one's beard 
creeping creeping all around the town (wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa)
