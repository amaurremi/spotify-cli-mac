[1mDAYS GONE BY (AUD LANG SYNE) [0m
 
should old acquaintance be forgot and never brought to mind 
           D                       A      A7        Bm         G             D 
should old acquaintance be forgot and all those days gone by 
 
for all those days gone by my dear 
for all those days gone by 
we'll take a cup of kindness yet 
for all those days gone by 
 
we two have been through darkened woods seen night and seen sun shine 
         D                       A      A7        Bm         G             D 
weâ€™ve wandered mile after mile to sing of days gone by 
so surely you will raise your glass and surely Iâ€™ll raise mine 
           D                       A      A7        Bm         G             D 
we'll turn our thoughts to years ago and pine for days gone by

we two have drifted in the stream and crossed the great divide 
           D                       A      A7        Bm         G             D 
while space and seas between us roar we'll drift to days gone by 
and thereâ€™s a hand my trusty friend come take this hand of mine 
           D                       A      A7        Bm         G             D 
weâ€™ll sing the songs that bring us close and think of days gone by
