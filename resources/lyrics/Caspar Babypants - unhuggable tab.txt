[1mUNHUGGABLE [0m
 
that bat out there in the summer air eats all the pesky bugs 
I know it seems kooky cause bats can be spooky 
but I'd like to give that bat a hug 
that snake at the zoo is a six foot long tube a hugging machine with a face 
but I'll paint you a picture of how a boa constrictor 
is not who you want to embrace 
 
unhuggable unhuggable but still part of the big circle 
this world is wide this world is full of the unhugga - ble of the unhuggable 
 
 
 
that spiny urchin down there perchin' 
has spikes that make me not want to tease it 
but up here from up above I can feel some love 
but it'll poke me if I try to squeeze it 
 
that porcupine is a friend of mine 
and I sure would love to cuddle 
but I can not ignore those quills anymore 
or the tears I would cry if we snuggled
