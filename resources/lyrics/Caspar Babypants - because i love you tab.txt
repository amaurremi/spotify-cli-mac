[1mBECAUSE I LOVE YOU [0m
 
caught in the rain it's not a pain because I love you 
noises in the night I don't feel a fright because I love you 
under a cloud I don't cry out loud because I love you 
lost in the woods I feel good because I love you 
 
and I'm gonna love you forever and ever 
you make me feel light as a feather 
no matter the noises no matter the weather it's true 
 
stuck in a storm my toes are warm because I love you 
stumble and fall I don't bother at all because I love you 
a bump in the road lightens my load because I love you 
the sun may fade I feel great because I love you 
 
 
a long way to climb I don't mind because I love you 
sharks in the waves I'm ok because I love you 
sand in my shoe I whistle a tune because I love you 
chased by a bear I don't care
