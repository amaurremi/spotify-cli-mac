[1mREASONS FOR THE SEASONS [0m
 
these are the reasons for the seasons 
that's why the world spins around and around 
everything is changing always rearranging 
all that I am saying is isn't it amazing 
the world keeps spinning around 
 
the reason that there is a spring     is to nourish growing things 
we're full of hope we're full of love       clouds dissapear sun's up above 
the nights get shorter and the days grow long 
a bird sings a springtime song 
 
the reason that there is a summer    is to fill the world with color 
flowers bright and trees are green     lazy days for you and me 
surfing through the waves in the sun at the beaches 
we can eat a million peaches 
 
the reason that there is a fall       is to chill out after all 
the long hot days they slow way down      all the greens turn to brown 
and a rainy wind blows as we huddle together 
here comes a change in the weather
