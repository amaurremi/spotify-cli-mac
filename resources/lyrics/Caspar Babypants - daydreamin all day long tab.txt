[1mDAYDREAMIN' ALL DAY LONG [0m
 
   let's dream of loopy winding roads for rabbit races 
let's dream of puffy suits for floating out on spaces 
                        F#7          G      
   let's dream of tiny roses in humongous vases 
   let's dream of things that don't but look like they have faces 
 
                       Bm      G                           F#7     G       
daydreamin' all      day long daydreamin' all     day long 
daydreamin' all   day long just me and you 
 
   let's dream of snacks we've never seen and then let's try them 
let's dream of airplanes made of clouds and then let's fly them 
                     F#7                    G      
let's dream of all the fish who'd like us both to dry them 
   let's dream of little bitty elephants and then let's ride them 
 
   let's dream of houses that are way too small to be in 
let's dream of sights that make us want to go sightseein' 
                     F#7           G      
let's dream of everybody finally agreein' 
   let's dream of nothing and be happy here just bein' 
 
                       Bm      G                           F#7     G       
daydreamin' all      day long daydreamin' all     day long 
daydreamin' all   day long just me and you        (3)
