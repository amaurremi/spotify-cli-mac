I feel better better better 
 
    my record album sat in the sun 
    it got all warpy and that was no fun 
    I felt bad then but now I feel    better 
 
    my sand castle was made out of sand 
    it fell apart when I touched it with my hand 
    I felt bad then but now I feel better 
 
    my favorite glass did tumble and shatter 
    in the future things like that glass don't matter 
    I felt bad then but now I feel better 
 
    I rode my bike over nails in the street 
    two flat tires made me sad and angry 
    I felt bad then but now I feel better
