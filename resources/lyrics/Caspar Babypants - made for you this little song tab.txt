[1mMADE FOR YOU THIS LITTLE SONG [0m
 
G                  B7                E 
    I made for you this little song 
   and it is just one minute long 
G              B7                  C     
   it has guitars that I did strum 
     and a really simple little drum 
G             B7                 E 
   I added harmonies for warmth 
   but I did not add any horns 
G                  B7               C     
   I made for you this little song 
     and it is just one minute long 
G           B7                    E 
   it only had a couple of chords 
   so I'll throw in a couple more 
G                B7              C     
   one microphone is all I need 
      and I can sing along with me (la la la) 
G                 B7                E 
   I made for you this little song 
   and it is just one minute long
