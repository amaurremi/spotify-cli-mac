don't you slither through the grass like a snake in the heat 
don't you leap like a frog on your froggie little feet 
don't you take a break or do a - ny - thing 
'cept jump like a jackrabbit shootin cross the street you gotta 
 
don't you glide through the air like a bird on the wing 
don't you pounce like a tiger they pounce on everything 
don't you stop that jumpy movment like a snake on a spring 
while I sing and sing and sing and sing and sing and sing and sing 
 
you can jump 
 
well every once in a while you need to stop and be still and don't move 
and be quiet    quiet    quiet    'till it's time    to
