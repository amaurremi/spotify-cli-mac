[1mJOY TO THE WORLD [0m
 
joy to the world it's Christmas time the lights light up the night 
the shops in town are bustling the people are all gathering 
raise your glass in cheer raise your glass in cheer 
Bm       G                  Em    A  D 
raaaaaaaaaaaise your glass in cheer  
 
joy to the world it's Christmas time the house is full of life 
the candlelight is glimmering the stars above are shimmering 
warm up near the fire warm up near the fire 
Bm       G              Em    A  D 
waaaaaaaaaarm up near the fire  
 
joy to the world it's charismas time the snow is here to stay 
the icicles are in a row we play them like a xylophone 
join us in our song join us in our song 
Bm       G             Em A    D 
jooooooooooin us in   our song 
 
joy to the world it's Christmas time the children stay up late 
the tree is lit and towering the joy is overpowering 
close your eyes and sleep close your eyes and sleep 
Bm       G              Em    A    D 
cloooooooose your eyes and sleep
