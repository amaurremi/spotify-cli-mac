JUST FOR YOU 
 
here comes the sunset just for you little baby here comes the sunset just for you 
Bm                                    D            Bm                         D 
prettiest thing that you've ever seen day to night we are in between 
here comes the sunset just for you little baby 
 
here comes the night sky just for you little baby here comes the night sky just for you 
Bm         D                   Bm                        D 
inky blue dark and wide day time creatures run and hide 
here comes the night sky just for you little baby 
 
here comes the moon just for you little baby here comes the moon just for you 
Bm                     D               Bm                     D 
reflecting in your sleepy eyes every night its a different size 
here comes the moon just for you little baby 
 
here come the stars just for you little baby here come the stars just for you 
Bm                  D                  Bm                       D 
twinkle twinkle sing the song space goes on and on and on 
here come the stars just for you little baby 
 
here comes mothers loving face little baby here comes fathers loving face 
Bm                     D          Bm        D 
one last look one last kiss fall into bedtime bliss 
here comes mothers loving face little baby 
here come the stars just for you little baby 
here comes the moon just for you little baby 
here comes the night sky just for you little baby 
here comes the sunset just for you
