[1mCALL THE CROOKED CROWS (transposed from A# to A) [0m
 
I was having a big halloween party and I needed a band to play some spooky songs 
but who can keep it creepy while the lights are low 
somebody suggested that I call the crooked crows 
caw caw caw someone call the crows caw caw caw call the crooked crows 
 
well they showed up late in a shiny black car they pulled out bass drums and a black guitar 
they stomped on a fuzz box 'till it sounded better 
and everybody there shook a tail feather 
 
caw caw caw someone call the crows caw caw caw call the crooked crows 
 
well they played 'till two when everybody said 
the gloomy tunes were good but now it's time for bed 
but the crows didn't stop bangin' on those drums 
on and on and on un---til the sun was coming up come on 
 
 
I can't make them leave or stop the freaky music  
I tried to call the cops but they're all just dancin' to it 
now I have a party that never seems to end 
come on over anytime and you can dance again 
 
caw caw caw someone call the crows caw caw caw call the crooked crows 
caw caw caw someone call the crows caw caw caw you can't stop those crooked crows 
come on! - A   G   D   A (2)  A  G  F#  G  A  D  A
