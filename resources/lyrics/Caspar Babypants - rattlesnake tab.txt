rattlesnake oh rattlesnake what makes your tail shake? 
a good old tune and a jug of juice  
that's all that it will take  
that's all that it will take all that it will take 
 
rattlesnake oh rattlesnake what makes you want to bite? 
I don't really want to but I'm scared 
of noises in the night  
noises in the night noises in the night 
 
rattlesnake oh rattlesnake why is your home so hot? 
I been living in the desert all my life 
and it's the only home I've got  
the only home I've got the only home I've got 
 
who's makin' that sound who's that makin' that (rattlesnake) 
who's makin' that who's makin' that who's makin' that  
 
rattlesnake oh rattlesnake why are you hard to find? 
I don't go out for long long walks 
that hawk's no friend of mine  
that hawk's no friend of mine    no friend of mine
