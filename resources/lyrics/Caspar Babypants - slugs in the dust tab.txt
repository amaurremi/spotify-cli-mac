[1mSLUGS IN THE DUST [0m
 
   I was wandering down a dusty country road 
came upon some slugs in the middle goin' slow 
   I felt a song come on and this is how it goes 
 
slugs in the dust they take their chances when they must 
slugs in the dust they crawl through the unknown and trust 
Bm               F#m                G                     A               Caug 
that they will make it 'cause all they are are slugs in the dust 
 
   the slugs were slimey and the road was wide and dry 
they probably wouldn't make it but they were not scared to try 
I saw the look of determination in their primitive eyes 
 
   I was afraid a car would come and run them down 
   I offered to carry them across to higher ground 
but they said "no, we will make it on our own somehow" 
 
   so I left them to struggle across that dirty road 
   dead leaves and dust sticking to them as they go 
   I promised to sing this song so everyone would know 
 
slugs in the dust they take their chances when they must 
slugs in the dust they crawl through the unknown and trust 
Bm               F#m                G                     A                Bm   F#m 
that they will make it 'cause all they are are slugs in the dust 
G                     A               Bm  F#m  G                     A               Caug 
all they are are slugs in the dust        all we are are slugs in the
