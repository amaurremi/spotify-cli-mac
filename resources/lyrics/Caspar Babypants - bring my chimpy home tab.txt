[1mBRING MY CHIMPY HOME [0m
 
left his home lost his way chimpy was tired and cold 
went for a walk gone for a day chimpy's only two years old 
he just can't find the path back to where he belongs 
he needs to take a bath so hold his hand strike up the band 
sing this wandering song 
 
   bring chimpy home       bring chimpy home      bring chimpy home to me (2) 
all day long all night long and if you see him please 
oh     oh     bring my chimpy home 
 
still out wandering to this day chimpy's now three years old 
there's his favorite soup I made coolin' in his bowl 
he just can't turn around and make his way home to me 
so I make a calling sound all day long all night long 
and if you see him please 
 
   bring chimpy home       bring chimpy home      bring chimpy home to me (2) 
all day long all night long and if you see him please 
oh     oh     bring my chimpy home 
oh     oh     bring my chimpy home 
oh     oh     bring my chimpy home
