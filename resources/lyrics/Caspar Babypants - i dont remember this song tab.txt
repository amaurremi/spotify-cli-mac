[1mI DON'T REMEMBER THIS SONG [0m
 
I don't remember this song I don't remember this song  
I don't know how the chorus goes cause I don't remember this song 
 
might have been about a snake but I can't remember the verse  
Bm                                                   D                            E 
might have been about a poodle but I can't remember the words 
might have been about a bear but I can't remember the parts 
it's all just a blank now how in the heck does it start? 
 
but I know I wrote a song I think it was about fish 
  Bm                           D                         E 
I know I wrote a song I think it was about pigs 
I know I wrote a song I think it was about bananas 
I know I wrote a song but - I - can't - re - mem - ber - the - beat 
 
but I will always remember this bridge I will always remember this bridge 
Bm                               D         E 
it is so important to the overall structure of the song I can't recall 
 
I don't remember this song I don't remember this song  
I don't know how the chorus goes but I do remember the big finish
