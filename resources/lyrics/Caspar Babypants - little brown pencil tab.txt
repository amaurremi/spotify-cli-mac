[1mLITTLE BROWN PENCIL [0m
 
little brown pencil you are the only one I choose 
little brown pencil always there but seldom used 
that is why I pick you up and never put you down 
me and my pencil are gonna color everything brown brown brown 
 
I pick it up when I want to color a fireworks display 
clown cars full of colorful clowns on a sunny summer day 
snow flakes falling on mountain tops or fire trucks racing by 
if my pencil found out everything is not brown    
it would break down and cry 
 
I pick it up when I want to color birthday party balloons 
zerbas on a rainbow or a bowl of delicious fruit 
ocean scenes with tropical fish or flowers bursting bright 
if my pencil found out everything is not brown  
it would break down and cry 
 
 
I don't know how many more times I can sharpen you 
one day you will dissapear I guess I'll switch to blue but 
 
little brown pencil           I'll love you little brown pen - cil 
I love you little brown pencil           you're still my little brown pencil
