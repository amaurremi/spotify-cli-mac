[1mDROWSY DOPEY DOZY DOG [0m
 
    old dog there in the weeds laid out under shady shade trees 
was a puppy now you leave it be you're a drowsy dopey dozy dog 
   dog like to sleep all day dog's favorite trick is to stay 
you don't fetch or jump or play you're a drowsy dopey dozy dog 
   I threw your chew toy in the trash you used to chew it but those days are past 
since then you ran out of gas you're a drowsy dopey dozy dog 
   busy birds they tweet and talk other pets go out for long walks 
you're not that brand of dog you're a drowsy dopey dozy dog 
 
whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa 
whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa 
 
   you obey all of gravity's laws you'd like to run but your paws are on pause 
no reason just because you're a drowsy dopey dozy dog 
 
whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa 
whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
