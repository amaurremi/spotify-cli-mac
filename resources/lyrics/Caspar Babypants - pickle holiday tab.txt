I saw a pickle jump out of a jar I saw a pickle leave the house 
I saw a pickle board a big airplane I do not understand 
I saw a pickle check in to a hotel I saw a pickle swimming in the sea 
I saw a pickle on a luxury cruise I do not understand 
I saw a pickle play a round of golf I saw a pickle sleeping on the beach 
I saw a pickle eating out at night I do not understand 
I saw a pickle get back on a plane I saw a pickle fly home to my house 
I saw a pickle jump back in the jar I do not understand 
 
but now I understand now I see why it's OK 
now I understand today's a pickle holiday
