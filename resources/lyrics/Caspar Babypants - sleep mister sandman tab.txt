[1mSLEEP MISTER SANDMAN  [0m
 
intro - D 
 
  you calmed the planet with your song 
  everyone now sleeps who sang along 
    no rest for you how bittersweet 
 
   sleep    mister sandman sleep 
 
   you'll always have more work to do 
   another night comes scrolling into view 
     so like a mantra we repeat 
 
     you helped us all to relax 
     find our beds and collapse 
     you must be feeling really beat so sleep 
 
   your stardust helps our eyelids fall 
   dark side of the earth heard your call 
    we wish that you could join our dreams
