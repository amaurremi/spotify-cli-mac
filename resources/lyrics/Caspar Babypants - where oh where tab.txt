where oh where has my little dog gone? where oh where can he be? 

with his ears so soft and his tail so long where oh where can he be? 
where oh where has my little cat gone? where oh where can he be? 
with his fur so black and his purr so sweet where oh where can he be? 
 
D                  A          Bm                     E7   G                           D       G   Gdim Em 
I looked everywhere I hope they know I care where oh where oh where can they be? 
 
where oh where can my little fish be? where oh where can she be? 
with her eyes so big and her scales so gold where oh where can she be? 
where oh where can my little bird be? where oh where can he be? 
with his big yellow beak and his green and blue wings where oh where can he be? 
 
D                  A          Bm                                  E7

where oh where oh where can they be? 
 
where oh where can my little frog be? where oh where can she be? 
with her big wide mouth and her sticky lick tongue where oh where can she be?
