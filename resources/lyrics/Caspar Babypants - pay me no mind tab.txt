[1mPAY ME NO MIND [0m
 
duck don't pay me no mind duck don't pay me no mind 
circling back with a good bye quack duck don't pay me no mind 
 
pony don't pay me no mind pony don't pay me no mind 
hand full of hay look the other way pony don't pay me no mind 
 
cow don't pay me no mind cow don't pay me no mind 
swish that tail drink from a pail cow don't pay me no mind 
 
horse don't pay me no mind horse don't pay me no mind 
flies in your hair chew and stare horse don't pay me no mind 
 
I sure wish that you would pay attention to 
me and be my friend the fun would never end 
but you are doing your thing and I can't catch your eye 
I guess I will buzz off now like some silly little fly 
life would be so sweet if we could harmonize  
 
dog don't pay me no mind dog don't pay me no mind 
rather be alone chewin' on a bone dog don't pay me no mind
