[1mANNABELLE PANCAKE  [0m
 
     it's 5am and the forest animals line up for breakfast 
     the cook is in the kitchen making pancakes for everyone 
     the griddle is hot and the animals are super duper hungry 
     they wait in line while the cook makes stacks of sweet little pancakes 
 
     but one of those pancakes       has other ideas 
     she wants to be free to ruuuun ruuuun 
 
(and her name is) Annabelle Pancake she's jumping up and rolling away       (x2) 
    
     all the animals in line      see a pancake rolling away 
     they can't believe their eyes  
they're all incredibly hungry so they start to chase it 
     the fox is fast but the bear is big and jumps out ahead 
     the squirrel is zippy but none of them are faster than the crazy little pancake 
 
     it feels good to roll       over the mossy forest floor 
     she reaches a clearing in the suuuun suuuun
