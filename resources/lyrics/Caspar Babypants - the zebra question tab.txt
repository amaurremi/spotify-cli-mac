[1mTHE ZEBRA QUESTION  [0m
 
(transposed from F to E for ease of playing) 
 
   I counted up the stripes I told myself I knew 
I asked myself the question and I ask the same of you 
can you tell me please and I wrong or am I right? 
          is a zebra white with black stripes       or is it black with white? 
 
I grabbed a dictionary but it was no help 
the definition said find out for yourself 
the question remains and keeps me up at night 
          is a zebra white with black stripes       or is it black with white? 
    
   I don't know I don't know I don't know  
   I don't know I don't know I don't know  
   I don't know I don't know I don't know  
 
I thought about breaking in to the zoo 
to find myself a zebra to put the question to 
I tried to sneak in but the guard was uptight 
          is a zebra white with black stripes       or is it black with white?
