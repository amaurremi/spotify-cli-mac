[1mRAIN AND THUNDER  [0m
 
darkness spakles when it calls electric flashes water falls 
puddles in the shadows under 
 
B                                                  
do you hear the rain and thunder?  
do you hear the rain and thunder?  
 
wet wet leaves and skies are booming dark dark clouds the storm is looming 
stirred up from the heat of summer 
 
dirt was brown and dirt was dusty now the dirt is dark and muddy  
I wonder is it any wonder? 
 
rivers run when rain is flowing nutshell boats with bugs all rowing 
splashing through ins boots of rubber 
 
booming bass when clouds go crash drops are dropping cymbal splash 
drips on leaves like crazy drummers 
 
now it's night and all is sleeping water's deep from clouds all weeping 
   C#                                               B 
a quiet mind means yummy slumber do you hear the rain and thunder?  
do you hear the rain and thunder?
