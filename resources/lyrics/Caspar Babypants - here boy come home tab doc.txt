[1mHERE BOY COME HOME [0m
 
poodle was bored sittin by the fire place 
eatin fancy treats off fine white china plates 
surrounded by paintings and a priceless flower vase life was way too slow 
 
    one day the front door was open just a bit 
    he was nervous but he knew that this was it 
    it's now or never time to make a run for it before that door would close 
 
    he felt the snowflakes melting on his poodle nose 
    he trotted down the street with no plan as to where to go 
    got lost right away in the dirty snow feet so cold and sore 
 
    pretty soon he was soaking wet and lonely 
    he missed his home all warm and homey 
    small poodle he wish he had a some money to take a taxi home 
 
    people's feet covered up his little tracks 
    soaked through and dreaming of a steaming bath 
    outta luck stuck wishin' he could find the path back to where he's known
