[1mWIDE BRIGHT EYES [0m
 
in your wide bright eyes 
you see your mom and daddy looking at their love 
and that love will help you lie still 
          Bm                 D                     E 
as we cradle you and rock you from above 
in your wide bright eyes 
you see the moon through the pines so wide and bright 
you are safe here in our arms dear 
        Bm                         D                    E 
even though the snow is cold and lonely white 
in your wide bright eyes 
you see the birds fly and glide in the sky 
they come down to land on me and you 
      Bm              D                            E 
and stay a while even though they're shy 
in your wide bright eyes 
you see a long unbroken string of happy days 
if I could I would make it understood 
       Bm                   D                           E 
that everything you need will come your way 
in your wide bright eyes 
you see a dome of darkness lined with little lights 
what else are days for but to be one more 
to be added to the one that's turned to night 
go on and add it to the one that's turned to night 
c'mon let's add it to the one that's turned to night 
go on and add it to the one that's turned to night
