[1mDIGGIN' WITH THE CLAMS [0m
 
digging one day by the beach down on my hands and my knees 
I found a hole with no end full of some new clammy friends 
   I widen the hole with my hand 
G       A       Bm 
   but this is such sandy land 
   no matter how fast that I dig 
   they always zag when I zig and I 
 
tunnel through the sand my only plan is  
diggin' with the clams (x4) 
 
and I'm gonna go wherever they go and follow follow follow follow x3 
 
once I dig deep enough down I find a whole clammy town 
they let me live there and stay learning their cute clammy ways 
   so crabber man throw back your crab 
G  A             Bm 
    fisherman empty the trap 
       clammers let your clams free 
   so they can dig with me and I 
 
tunnel through the sand my only plan is  
diggin' with the clams (x4) 
 
and I'm gonna go wherever they go and follow follow follow follow x3 
till the clams stop digging'
