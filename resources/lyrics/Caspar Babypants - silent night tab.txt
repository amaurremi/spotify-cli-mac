[1mSILENT NIGHT [0m
 
silent night quiet night all is calm all is bright 
rest your head now sweet little child  
tiny infant so tender and mild 
sleep in heavenly peace sleep in heavenly peace 
 
silent night quiet night snowflakes fall shimmering white 
all the world is covered in frost  
voices rising none lonely or lost 
sleep in heavenly peace sleep in heavenly peace 
 
silent night quiet night warm yourself with love's pure light 
sheltering homes bring a radiant glow  
night then dawn will bring brightening snow 
sleep in heavenly peace sleep in heavenly peace

silent night quiet night blankets of stars shines in our eyes  
shimmering streams from indigo skies  
watching over us from a great height 
sleep in heavenly peace sleep in heavenly peace
