[1mALL OF YOUR LIFE  [0m
 
   you spent all day learning to crawl someday soon you will do it all 
D                             G                          Bm 
but for now you can just be small that's you 
 
you spent a little while in the belly of your mom 
and someday soon you'll be grown and gone 
       D                           G                 Bm 
just follow your feet and it will not go wrong  
      E                              Bm                                   E 
for you cause you've got time you've got all of your life 
 
you might sleep under a blanket of stars 
or live uptown and drive a Cadillac car 
D                            G                             Bm 
float on the sea and strum a guitar that's you 
                 E               Bm                                  E 
you've got time that's you you've got all of your life 
 
 
you might grow up and have a fancy ranch 
or sleep in a bed made of moss and grass 
        D                  G                     Bm 
whatever you do it will be good for you  
you might like fine wine and stinky cheese 
you might join a circus and train the fleas 
          D                               G                         Bm 
you'll do what you're told or do as you please 
                  E               Bm                                  E 
you've got time that's you you've got all of your life
