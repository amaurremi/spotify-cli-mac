[1mBE IN THE SEA [0m
 
oh the sky is a cloudy ocean full of creatures that fly so free 
         G                                   D         Bm                     Em      A            D  
but a poor sea horse would be way off course and would rather be in the sea 
oh the dessert is a sandy ocean full of creatures that play hide and seek 
         G                                D               Bm              Em      A            D  
but a squid in the sand can't stay hidden and it would rather be in the sea 
oh the jungle is a woody ocean full of creatures that swing tree to tree 
         G                  D               Bm                     Em      A            D  
but a dolphin can't swim in the plants and would rather be in the sea 
oh space is a boundless ocean full of creatures that we can't see 
but an octopus in weightlessness would still rather be in the sea 
 
 
oh the night is a silent ocean full of creatures that sleep 
         G                                      D         Bm                 Em      A            D  
but a great white shark prefers a watery dark and would rather be in the sea 
oh the sea is a watery ocean full of creatures that live in the deep 
                  G                                   D            Bm  
and there's nowhere that they would hang their hats 
       Em          A             D     Bm        Em       A           D     Bm 
if it wasn't to be in the sea            it's got to be in the sea 
        Em            A             D     Bm        Em       A           D     Bm 
they just wanna be in the sea           it's got to be in the sea 
look and see what you can see in the sea
