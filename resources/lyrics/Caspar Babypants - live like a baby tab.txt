[1mLIVE LIKE A BABY [0m
 
I just want to live like a baby I don't want to grow up anymore  
I just want to live like a baby rolling around on the floor 
 
     I was born    I was small now I'm grown    big and tall  
when I was a baby the world seemed to be a cartoon made of dreams  
     I got love thats   radiatin' as if I'm always    meditatin' 
turns out life is like this simple song and if you want to   sing along  
 
oh oh oh we've all got a    long way to go    oh oh oh so long to go so why not 
 
cancel your insurance and stare at your toes 
abandon your car cause there's nowhere to go 
erase everyone from your telephone  do not pay your bills 
open your eyes and open your mind  the world is made of a twinkling light  
stop growing up for    goodness sake throw your computer in a lake 
 
I just want to live like a baby I don't want to grow up anymore  
I just want to live like a baby rolling around on the floor 
I just want to live like a baby I don't want to grow up anymore  
I just want to live like a baby rolling around rolling around 
rolling around on the floor
