G                    E                             D                         Bm 
goes so slow it might go backwards getting passed by walking black birds 
Em                  F#                      Bm 
even slugs and snails are faster (speed is not what this trains after) 
G                  E                 D                 Bm 
going slow is all it's up for listen to the train conductor 
 
G                         E                   D                       Bm 
if you're late then catch another wave bye bye to father and mother 
   Em                    F#                           Bm 
it takes an hour to leave the station (so you've got time for conversation) 
G                                E                        D                                 Bm 
lower your window and blow them kisses through the station the engine hisses 
 
 
G                          E                 D                   Bm 
bridge is out don't make a fuss this train is amphibious 
      Em            F#                      Bm 
the only train I know that floats (better than the floatiest boats) 
G                          E                D                       Bm 
back on track and at full steam hear the whistle time to leave
