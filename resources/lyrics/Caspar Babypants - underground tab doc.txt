[1mUNDERGROUND [0m
 
when you're underground the roots from the trees 
will tickle your face and elbows and knees 
           Em                   Bm 
as you dig and dig you might meet a grub 
munching on the dirt under your favorite shrub 
when you're underground could be day could be night 
as you dig even deeper down you just might 
           Em                   Bm 
meet a mole in a tunnel watching tv 
he'll invite you in for a hot cup of tea 
when you're underground you'll see the worms looking proud 
all dressed for the show what a good looking crowd 
      Em                          Bm 
and listen to the dirty violins and the flutes 
the concert hall is made of rocks and roots 
 
when you're underground (yeah yeah yeah) 
 
when you're underground you'll hear the mushrooms sing  
sing about the dampness and the rocks and things 
         Em                      Bm 
when one sings high the others do too 
they sing rock and roll and the blue blue blue blues 
when you're underground you might miss the sun 
but there are plenty of muddy funny ways to have fun 
               Em                         Bm 
you could do a dance with the beetles and the snakes 
the people up top will think its    an earthquake
