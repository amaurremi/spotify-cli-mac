[1mLULLABY IN THE SKY [0m
 
  blue night and a swishin of branches high 
  blue night and a lullaby in the sky 
  purple light purple light in the hazy sun 
  and the cool air of the evening has begun 
  look up soak in the sunset close your eyes 
  lay back rest your ears let the notes float by 
  outer space is pluckin and pickin on a sweet banjo 
  breathe deep slide into sleep and hover down so low 
 
   lullaby in the sky (4) 
 
  open up both of your ears and let it in 
  low notes float in on a cold thin wind 
  low notes so simple just one two three  
  below bass line creepin between the trees 
  you sleep cozy underneath the warm dry leaves 
  dont move listen to the xlophones breathe 
  warm blanket pulled up around your chinny chin chin 
  low cloud daylight hours are just about to begin again 
 
  close your eyes and listen to the lullabies
