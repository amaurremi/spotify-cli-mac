[1mMISTER CLOUD [0m
 
you are a million billion droplets of water 
you disappear when the sun gets hotter 
I saw you in the valley as fog 
you looked so fluffy and white 
you live in the sky and I'm talking to you 
  
Mister Cloud 
I'm talkin' to you Mister Cloud (x2)  I'm talking to you 
 
a rainy rain storm fell out of your bottom 
and into rivers running rapid in autumn 
you come from oceans and you'll be back again  
you look so different when 
you live in the sky and I'm talking to you 
 
 
you look like elephants now you look like a donkey 
if I squint at you I see a big weird monkey 
you change a lot and you are never the same 
you live in the sky and I'm talking to you mister cloud 
       
I'm talkin' to you Mister Cloud (x3)
