[1mROCKIN' ROBIN [0m
 
he rocks in the treetops all day long hoppin' and a boppin' and singing his song 
all the little birds on jaybird street love to hear the robin go tweet tweet tweet 
rockin' robin rock rock rockin' robin'  
go rockin' robin 'cause we're really gonna rock tonight  
 
every little swallow every chickadee every little bird in the tall oak tree 
the wise old owl and the big black crow flappin' their wings signin' go bird go 
 
a pretty little raven at the bird's first dance 
taught him how to do the bop and it was grand 
they started going steady and bless my soul 
he out bopped the buzzard and the oriole
