[1mFREE COUCH [0m
 
hey mommy and daddy it's me your baby tick 
calling from the city 'cause I know you're worried sick 
    I know you fret but don't fret about me 
I found a place to live and best of all it's free 
 
   mommy don't freak out I'm livin' in a free couch 
    daddy don't freak out I'm livin' in a free couch 
hanging out with the ticks in the city  
look me up if you want to get down 
but please don't freak out mommy and daddy I'm livin in a free 
couch (freeeeeeee couch) 
 
the life of a tick is short and boring 
I had to mix it up and I felt like exploring 
so I went to the city to make it on my own 
someone put this couch in the street and now it is my home 
 
    you'd like my roommates they're a bunch of funny bugs 
spiders ants and beetles and one super lazy slug 
    this couch is home to one and all 
and every saturday night we break out the disco ball
