close your eyes little sleeper close your eyes little sleeper 
our love is deep and you can sleep all  
night little sleeper close your eyes 
you know we've got you tight so close your eyes 
 
there are garbage trucks dumping garbage but nowhere near 
tidal waves and hurricanes don't happen here 
the goblins are all napping so they can't give you a fright 
so get under your covers and we'll leave on the light

and all you want is a mouth full of thumb 
and tickle spiders to tickle you 'till you go numb 
don't think about those monsters as they pass right by our home  
just turn off all your worries 'cause you are not alone 
 
close your eyes little sleeper close your eyes little sleeper 
our love is deep and you can sleep all  
night little sleeper close your eyes 
you know we've got you tight (X3) 
so close your eyes
