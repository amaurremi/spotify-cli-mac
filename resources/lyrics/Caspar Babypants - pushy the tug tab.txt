[1mPUSHY THE TUG  [0m
 
she pushes freighters here she pushes barges there 
she pushes all the ocean liners around 
she has a    dusty stack and a dirty deck 
and she always has a sad looking frown 
when captains see her comin they just moan and shrug 
I guess were gettin' pushed by      pushy the tug 
 
she pushes every one who comes into the busy busy harbor 
all the other tugs wait at the docks 
she makes the dhingys feel nervous and the sailboats are scared  
and the seagulls fly away from her in flocks 
when crewmen hear her horn they just sigh and give up 
cut your engines boys and don't argue with pushy the tug 
 
one day in to the harbor came a shiny happy whistle  
and a boat back lit by the sun 
it was a brand new vesel with a coat of yellow paint 
a tight ship second to none 
let's strike up the band and cut a rug 
cause everybody's gonna get a hug from huggy the tug
