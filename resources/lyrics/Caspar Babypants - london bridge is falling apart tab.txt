well if all the kings men could not fix humpty dumpty 
how they gonna fix a bridge that's brittle split and crumbly 
someday they will replace the wood brick by brick 
for now they will repair it slowly stick by stick

well Mother Goose would rather paddle across than use it 
the mouse from hickory dickory dock chooses not to choose it 
Jack was nimble Jack was quicker than any man 
but Jack would rather catch a boat than walk accross that span

well the Duke of York marched his men up and down it 
and when they did parts and pieces and bits were fallin' off it 
Mary Mary quite contrary said the bridge was stable 
then she swam across that river just as fast as she was able (go Mary go)
