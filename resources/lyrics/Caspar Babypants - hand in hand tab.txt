[1mHAND IN HAND [0m
 
like the world      needs outer   space so it can spin 
like the rivers      need the snow to melt into them 
I can feel love        holding the whole thing together 
and I'm happy     to be by your side 
 
hand in hand hand in hand we're  hand in hand hand in hand we're 
hand in hand hand in hand in hand  
 
like the trees        need a seed to begin to grow 
like the valleys      need high hills so they stay low 
I can feel love         holding the whole thing together 
and I'm happy     to be by your side 
 
air needs light to make it glow 
music needs the radio 
now needs the past and tomorrow 
we need time to go by slow 
and I'm happy     to be by your side
