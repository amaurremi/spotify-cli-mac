[1mRUBBER BALL [0m
 
this here's the story of a toy I dearly loved 
I lost it a lot but then it would show up 
how it bounced back no one could recall 
I missed my toy when it was not near 
but pretty soon it would reappear 
rubber ball rubber ball 
 
I lost it in the juniper bush one day 
I was sad to think that the rubber would decay 
down there all summer and all fall 
late last night what a sight 
it was back in my room in the pale moonlight  
rubber ball rubber ball 
 
Dad was mowing the lawn and he mowed it down 
made a chop chop chop chop choppy sound 
he threw it in the trash but that's not all 
ripped and torn it was back by the morn  
store bought fresh like when it was born 
rubber ball rubber ball
