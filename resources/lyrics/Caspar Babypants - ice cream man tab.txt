[1mICE CREAM MAN [0m
 
ride your bicycle up and down 
follow follow follow the jingle bell sound 
pedal pedal pedal as fast as you can 
       B                               D             E      A E A      E   A  E 
you can't catch me I'm the ice cream man        yes I am 
 
drive my truck all over the world 
got 37 flavors all of them swirled 
drive drive drive as fast as I can 
       B                               D             E      A E A      E   A  E 
you can't catch me I'm the ice cream man 
 
strawberry and nut bar crunch (I want one) 
orange popsicles by the bunch (I want one) 
I go go go as fast as I can 
      B                                D                 E   A E  
you can't catch me I'm the ice cream man

toodle bop bop bop toodle toodle bop bop bop toodle  
toodle bop bop bop toodle bop bop bop toodle bop bop bop toodle
