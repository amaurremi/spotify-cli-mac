  there are some animals that get up when the moon is full 
and when that moon is gone they stretch and start to yawn 
F                             C#7                                          G#    
  they do not like daylight they can't wait for another night 
to party on your lawn 'till the break of dawn 
 
    cyotes need the dark to hunt for tasty snacks  
    in the shadows rats eat cheese out of the traps 
    raccoons leave for work and give thier babies hugs 
    hedgehogs use the gloom to dig for sleepy bugs 
    owls turn thier heads round and round and round 
    frogs on logs make a symphony of sound 
    they all belong to a    nocturnal club 
they run from the sun when the sun is coming up 
 
 
    so should you wake up from your sleep      listen oh so carefully 
    you might hear them sing this night time song 
    and if you do sing along 
 
'till the break of dawn on and on   on and on   on and on     (3) 
until the break of dawn
