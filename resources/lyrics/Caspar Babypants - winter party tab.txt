[1mWINTER PARTY [0m
 
everyone is here grinning ear to ear 
they all took disco naps and avoided hunters traps 
polar bear is spinning tracks snowy owl is eating snacks 
everyone arrives and the party comes to life 
 
spent the wintertime chillin outside frosty birds on a telephone line  
  we're having a winter    party 
singing in the choir sittin by the fire up on tip toe it's drifting higher  
  we're having a winter    party 
another year to grow while the icy winds blow make a little ball and give it a throw  
  we're having a winter    party 
 
(solo)  A  G  D  E (x2) 
 
the penguins all take turns dancing with the arctic terns 
every seal is there but not the sleeping bears 
the fox he got the dates all wrong so he cannot stay too long 
but the fox has got the time to sing this little song 
 
(end)  A  G  D  E (repeat to fade)
