[1mFLY HIGH BRIGHT FIREFLY [0m
 
I see you in the warm grass I hear you cry by my toe 
you tell me you are worried you won't make a bright enough glow 
your friends fly around twinkling you just have to give it a try 
I am here to remind you you can 
 
fly high bright firefly (wa wa wa wa wa wa wa) (3) 
fly high bright firefly        (whoa whoa) 
 
climb up on my finger stretch out those pretty little wings 
turn on your lamplight jump off and start sparkling 
brighter than a porch light you are the star of a luminescent show 
I am here to remind you you can 
 
fly high bright firefly (wa wa wa wa wa wa wa) (3) 
fly high bright firefly        (whoa whoa) 
fly high bright firefly (I am the firefly    look at me glow) (2) 
fly high bright firefly        (whoa whoa)
