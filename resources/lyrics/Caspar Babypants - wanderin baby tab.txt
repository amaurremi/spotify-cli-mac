[1mWANDERIN' BABY [0m
 
out the door out the door  
wanderin' baby went out the door 
out in the snow where will you go?  
wanderin' baby ran out in the snow 
wanderin' baby just barely born  
how you gonna keep your baby toes warm? 
wanderin' baby might I inquire do you wanna come home and sit by the fire? 
back inside back inside wanderin' baby come back inside 
 
out the door out the door  
wanderin' baby went out the door  
out in the woods that's not good  
wanderin' baby ran out in the woods 
wanderin' baby where you gonna sleep?  
makin' a bed out of moss and weeds 
wanderin' baby what you gonna eat? do you wanna come home and have a treat? 
back inside back inside wanderin' baby come back inside
