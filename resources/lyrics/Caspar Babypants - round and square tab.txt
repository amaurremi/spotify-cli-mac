[1mROUND AND SQUARE [0m
 
I remember the day when round met square 
at the barbershop getting hair cuts for their hair 
they both got mohawks and started to stare 
Em                            G               A          Caug  G 
that was the day that round met square 
nobody thought that they could be friends 
they were obviously different and then yet again 
they both liked ice cream and walks in the wind 
      Em                                 G                   A         Caug  G 
but still nobody thought that they could be friends 
the national news reported the pair 
walking in the park they were photographed there 
everyone wondered how a round and a square 
         Em                          G               A     Caug  G 
could possibly make such a cute little pair? 
other shapes saw that right was right 
polygons and rectangles came out at night 
a cube and a cone were hand in hand in daylight 
and everything was starting to feel alright 
 
 
these days you can see a straight line 
out with a point at a restaurant to dine 
and it's hard to believe that there ever was a time 
when a round with a square was a national news headline
