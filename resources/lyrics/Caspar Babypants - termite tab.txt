   termite moving in to my house I did not invite 'em and I want 'em out 
termite tell me that I need to move tiny termite so brave and rude 
termite dig right in and start to chew this is my house but to them it is food 
termite make a thousand tunnels a day I wish they'd eat a log and go away 
   go away go away go away termite 
 
   termite make a hole in my floor I had some walls but now I don't any more 
termite make a hole in my roof here comes the rain and I'm not waterproof 
termite that's enough it's time to go poison and traps but they all say no 
termite I'd ask you individually but there's millions of you and only one of me  
   one of me one of me one of me 
 
        termite kept on chewing throughout the night 
        all I had left were windows and pipes 
        I finally had to go but when I looked back 
        all that I saw was the chimney stack 
 
 
      termite moving away from my house 
      ate all the wood now they're moving out 
      next time I'll build my place out of stone 
      then maybe termite will leave me alone  
   leave me alone leave me alone leave me alone  
 
       termite! (chew chew chew chew chew chew chew) (4)
