[1mPUMPKIN IN THE PINES [0m
 
Halloween was weeks ago and time it does march on 
all the gourds that used to smile are garbage now and gone 
Bm        Em    Am             C             D         G 
all have decomposted now turned to wormy mush 
Bm                 G       C       Am                   C      G D G 
all deep under heavy snow someday turn to slush 
 
but on a chilly night like this some children once did see 
a glowing orange and smiling face floating in the trees 
       Bm     Em          Am                      C            D      G 
what did it want why was it there what made it's eerie light 
Bm                 G        C          Am                   C                  G D G 
let me tell you what I know it happened to me just last night 
 
I saw the vision hovering and so I stepped right outside 
the pumpkin startled just a bit but did not run to hide 
     Bm              Em      Am                C          D        G 
we stood there staring at each other still and eye to eye 
      Bm               G             C          Am                   C    G D G 
but neither of us moved an inch we couldn't if  we'd tried 
 
finally the pumpkin sang a low and spooky song 
"I'm cold and hungry and so alone and all my friends are gone" 
   Bm            Em        Am                C           D         G 
"I don't know why I'm still around or why my candle glows" 
       Bm                G        C          Am                    C          G D G 
"but can I come in for a while and warm up do you suppose?"
