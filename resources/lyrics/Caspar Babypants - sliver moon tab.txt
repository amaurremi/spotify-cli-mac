[1mSLIVER MOON [0m
 
sliver moon sliver moon shine your light in my room 
shine your light and I see you look down on me 
hide 'till I find you behind trees I love the way you slowly fade 
 
sliver moon sliver moon where's the dish where's the spoon? 
did a cow really jump up and over you? 
in the shade orbit away sky is turning blue I love the way you slowly fade 
 
 
sliver moon sliver moon gone away way too soon 
gone away in the clouds and now I do miss you 
some day you'll stay and make me swoon I love the way you slowly fade
