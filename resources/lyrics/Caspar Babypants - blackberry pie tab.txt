gonna eat it now now now and smile wide wide wide 
I hear a caw caw caw from over head head head 
there in the sky sky sky is a big black bird bird bird

blackbird sees me me me from in the sky sky sky 
he stares at me me me with a little black eye eye eye 
he swoops on down down down right down at me me me 
and with his claws claws claws he grabs my pie pie pie

I watch my pie pie pie fly up so high high high 
I wonder why why why he stole my pie pie pie 
he drops it down down down toward the ground ground ground 
it turns around round round it's falling down down down 
 
it hits my plate plate plate with a great big splat splat splat 
it is a mess mess mess my pie is flat flat flat  
I watch the bird bird bird laugh in the sky sky sky 
I eat my pie pie pie and smile wide wide wide
