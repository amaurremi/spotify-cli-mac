[1mCHICKEN IN THE CORNBREAD [0m
 
made a batch of cornbread made it for my lunch 
put it out to cool on my back porch 
heard a little scratchin' heard a little peck 
chicken in the cornbread what the heck 
made a batch of cornbread made it just for me 
put it out to cool put it in a tree 
heard a funky flappin' high up in the sky 
chicken took a lesson chicken learned to fly chicken learned to fly 
 
I was gonna eat cornbread for a week 
but you put your beak all over my treat 
 
made a batch of cornbread made enough to save 
put it out to cool put it in a cave 
would have made a fire but I couldn't make a spark 
chicken in the cornbread chicken in the dark 
made a batch of cornbread mixed it with a spoon 
put it out to cool put it on the moon 
came out fluffy 'cause of gravity 
chicken in a moon suit starin' at me starin' at me
