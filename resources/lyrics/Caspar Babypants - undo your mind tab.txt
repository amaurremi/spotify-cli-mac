[1mUNDO YOUR MIND  [0m
 
touching a cloud with your small fingertips 
dream about tree tops and flying and this 
is all that your baby thoughts now needs to think 
so undo your mind and fall 
 
skimming the stars with your small fingertips 
round the round planets so dizzy and this 
is all that your baby thoughts now needs to think 
so undo your mind and fall 
 
tickling the waves with your small fingertips 
handfulls of sand from the shoreline and this 
is all that your baby thoughts now needs to think 
so undo your mind and fall 
 
 
flicking the switch with your small fingetips 
turing the light in to darkness and this 
is all that your baby thoughts now needs to think 
so undo your mind and fall
