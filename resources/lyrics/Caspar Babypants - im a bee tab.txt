[1mI"M A BEE [0m
 
I'm a bee a bee is me I'm a bee and a bee is me 
and a bee like me likes to eat eat eat and bother everybody on the beach 
 
all I wanna do is land on you and eat your food I don't mean to be rude  
but you're eating a popsicle a sugary popsicle I like popsicle I gotta get popsicle 
a big fat hand is swattin at me I wonder if I should stay or leave 
but I want sugar and all a I think about is me me me 
 
OK OK let's try this again this would be so much easier if you and I were friends 
you're eating a sno-cone a delicious sno-cone I want sno-cone I need sno-cone 
zig zag zig zag up and down I'm not trying to fly silly I'm not a bee clown 
a bee sized bite is all I need and I will leave you be so 
 
please please please share your treats with the 
bees bees bees lemme have a bite and I'll 
leave leave leave I'm askin' you politely please please  
 
this beach is hot and I gotta stay cool and your ice cream cone is makin' me drool 
and it's minty chip I like minty chip my favorite flavor is minty chip 
now your hand is back shooin me off in a minute that ice cream will be too soft 
to land on so I will settle for a dribble on your sunburned cheek
