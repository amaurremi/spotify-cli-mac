[1mJINGLE BELLS [0m
 
dashing through the snow in a one horse open sleigh 
over the fields we go laughing all the way 
bells on bobtail ring making spirits bright 
oh what fun it is to sing a sleighing song tonight oh 
 
jingle bells jingle bells jingle all the way 
oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh (hey) 
jingle bells jingle bells jingle all the way 
oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh 
 
a day or two ago I thought I'd take a ride 
and soon Miss Katy Bright was seated by my side 
the horse was lean and fed and oh so set to go 
but got into a drifted bank and we tumbled in the snow oh 
 
then just yesterday with Miss Katy Bright 
I went out on the snow and fell down on the ice 
a gent was riding by in a one-horse open sleigh 
he laughed as I sat sprawling then he quickly drove away oh
