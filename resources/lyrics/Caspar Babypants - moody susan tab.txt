[1mMOODY SUSAN [0m
well she's been sad cause nothing goes her way 
and she's been happy when she gets to play outside all day 
and she's been naughty that's when she sports a big bad frown 
 
I'm introducin' Moody Susan she is both up and down 
 
and when she's bored all she can do is drool 
she plays it cool when she's in an ice cold swimming pool 
she's been so silly some say she'll grow up to be a clown 
 
I'm introducin' Moody Susan she is both up and down 
 
she gives out love (love love) unconditionally 
she is dependable but babies are traditionally 
she gets lonely when her baby friends leave town 
 
I'm introducin' Moody Susan she is both up and down 
 
she's feeling great then bad again an emotional chameleon 
from day to day she can't help change she goes from sad to Zen 
but so does Jen and Sven and Ken 
everybody's got moody friends
