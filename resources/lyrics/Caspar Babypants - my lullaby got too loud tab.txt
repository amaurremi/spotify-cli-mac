[1mMY LULLABY GOT TOO LOUD [0m
 
let's see now 
night time cozy time rub your baby eyes 
the sandman sprinkles dust in them and that makes you feel alright 
jammies stuffies and right to bed I tried to write a lullaby but instead     
it got too loud I meant to whisper this tune to you as you drifted off to sleep 
my lullaby was meant to help a baby chill out but somehow it got too loud 
it got too loud 
 
bedtime sunsets and goodnight moon cozy under covers it'll be sleepy time soon 
how bout we shout about it and have a party instead so much more fun than bed 
so let's get loud all I wanted to sing was quiet and tender and hush now child 
my lullaby was meant to help a baby chill out but somehow it got too loud 
it got too loud 
 
 
A                                            A A# B C 
started out tiny little and sweet            something that I'd whisper quietly 
C B A# A                     
           slowly over time I added more sound  
'till it got so loud that I could not turn it down 
 
this was gonna be my lullaby (but it got too loud) 
this was gonna be my lullaby (but it got too loud)
