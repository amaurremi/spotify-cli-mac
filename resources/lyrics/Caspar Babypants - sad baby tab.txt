   sad baby     everybody loves you 
 
so alone and lost in tears there there I'm here baby dear 
let's hum a tune howl at the moon 
Bm                    Em    G                                Gm 
you'll feel better soon remember when you're blue that 
 
   sad baby     everybody loves you 
 
cry baby cry you cry it on out lie on your back do the twist and shout 
alone in your room you're sad that's true 
      Bm                    Em    G                                Gm 
but you'll feel better soon remember when you're blue 
 
E                     G     F#7                         G             
waaaaaaah wah wah waaaaaaah wah wah wah wah 
E                     G     F#7           G      A 
waaaaaaah wah wah waaaaaaah wah
