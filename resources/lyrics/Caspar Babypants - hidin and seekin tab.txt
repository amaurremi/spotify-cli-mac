I'm gonna have worms lookin' for you in the garden 
and I'm gonna have fish lookin' for you in the rivers 
and I'm gonna have goats lookin' for you in the mountains 
 
but I'm still countin' and you're still hidin' and I'm not peekin' 
hidin' and seekin' 
 
and I'm gonna have seagulls lookin' for you at the seaside 
and I'm gonna have bears lookin' for you in the forrest 
and I'm gonna have owls lookin' for you in the meadow 
 
but I'm still countin' and you're still hidin' and I'm not peekin' 
hidin' and seekin' 
 
 
and I'm gonna have pigs looking for you in the mud 
and I'm gonna have ducks looking for you at the pond 
and I'm gonna have monkeys looking for you in the jungle 
 
but I'm still countin' and you're still hidin' and I'm not peekin' 
hidin' and seekin'             (4)
