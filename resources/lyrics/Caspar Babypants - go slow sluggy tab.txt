   go slow sluggy go slow sluggy 
   don't worry or hurry or scurry you can 
   go slow sluggy go slow sluggy 
   don't hustle or bustle just shuffle away 
 
       everyones tries to win the big race 
C#m                              Bm               E 
       but your slimey line makes a lazy figure eight 
 
       everyone else flies by so fast 
C#m                                  Bm                        E 
       you check yourself and make this moment last and last and last 
 
 
       and what is time if you're never late 
C#m                     Bm                E 
       left behind to catch up at a later date
