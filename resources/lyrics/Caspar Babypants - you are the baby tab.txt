baby you are the baby and I love you so and I know you'll grow  
                      D                  Dm                   Bm  A    Bm   A    Bm   A  
but that don't matter to me can't you see? I love you love you love you 
because you're the baby the tiny tiny baby 
and you wear little pants and your socks always match 
        D                                   Dm               Bm  A    Bm   A    Bm   A  
and I love it when you do that baby dance I love you love you love you 
 
and if I tried to measure up just how much I love you 
it would be super crazy like from here to the moon  
and back again and again and again and again 
and again and again and again and again (times two) 
 
 
you are the baby you are the baby snug like a bird in a nest in a tree 
         D                          Dm      Bm  A    Bm   A    Bm   A  
crawl under my wing and let me love you love you love you 
 
baby you are the baby and I love you so and I know you'll grow
