[1mBENEATH THE WATER [0m
 
well it rained and it rained 
and the fish all got tired 
it poured and it poured 
and made a lullaby 
and it spilled and it spilled 
and made them close their eyes 
 
now they sleep beneath the water 
I see them when I swim 
they all sleep beneath the water 
and drift away when I dive in 
when I dive in 
           
well it stormed and it stormed  
but the fish were cozy 
it shook and it shook  
and the wind tore up the sky 
it moaned and it groaned 
but the fish stayed in their dreams
