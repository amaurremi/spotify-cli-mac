[1mWHO IN THE CIRCUS IS ME? [0m
 
I saw the circus last week and it made me stop and think 
if I flipped a coin and had to join  
who in the circus is me? 
would I swing high on a trapeze the thought makes me weak in the knees 
I'd be ready to fly and feel everyone's eyes  
on me and then I would freeze 
would I spit out a big ball of fire would I walk through the air on a wire? 
that all sounds appealing but I have a feeling  
professionals are who they should hire 
would I train the fleas to transform into a performing swarm 
that sounds exciting 'till the fleas start biting and  
everyone heads for the door 
 
 
I would join the clowns for fun in a car with a hundred and one 
but what would I do if I'm clown 102 my  
clown career would be done 
I think in the end I will stay in the crowd and be thrilled 
to watch the pros put on a show with  
daring and style and skill
