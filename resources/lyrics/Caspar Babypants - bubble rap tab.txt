[1mBUBBLE RAP [0m
 
I am a bubble and I was born in a bubble machine  
soapy water and a puff of air that's how I came to be 
I'm pleased to meet you so nice to great you how do you do? 
sit back relax and I'll tell you my story and every bit is true 
on a summer day in the heat of June on an island in the east 
a toy store flipped on a bubble machine and out popped me 
along with a billion other bubbles but I don't follow the crowd 
I ventured forth and headed north all the other bubbles they went south 
now being a bubble is easy as pie I'm pretty and shiny and new 
but if I land on a hand or touch the ground my good times will be through 
I was feeling nervous cause so much hurts us bubbles are weak 
I'm frail and poor and life is short that's why I wanna fly free 
 
this is a bubble rap from a bubble to you and me 
listen to this bubble rap and set your bubbles free  
this is a bubble rap from a bubble to you and me 
listen to this bubble rap and set your bubbles free
