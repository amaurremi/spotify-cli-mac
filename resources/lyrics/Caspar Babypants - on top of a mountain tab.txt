[1mON TOP OF A MOUNTAIN [0m
 
on top of a mountain all covered with snow 
I found my small baby so cold head to toe 
deep down in the valley all covered with green 
I found my small baby so happy and free 
way up in the country all mellow and cool (mellow and cool) 
I found my small baby in a warm little pool yeah 
in the heart of the city all lit up with lights 
I found my small baby awake in the night 
way out on the ocean surrounded by whales 
I found my small baby on a boat at full sail 
far out in the desert it's a hundred degrees (hundred degrees) 
I found my small baby so hot and thirsty yeah 
 
 
up high in the blue sky way too high to see (too high to see) 
I found my small baby free of gravity   yeah 
on top of a mountain all covered with snow  
I found my small baby and took that baby home
