[1mI THOUGHT I SAW BATS [0m
 
      black flappy shapes        are they birds with capes? 
      I scan the sky     and don't blink an eye 
      in the evening glow       I watch the show 
 
   hey hey what was that?      I thought I saaaaaaaaw   bats 
 
      they fly and eat       grab an insect treat 
      they see and hear        with radar ears 
      I'll try to stay       out of their way 
 
 
      night turns to day       zoom to the cave 
      I'll join the crowd        hang upside down 
      be light as leaves        and hard to see
