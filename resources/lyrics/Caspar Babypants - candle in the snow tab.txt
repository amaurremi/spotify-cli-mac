[1mCANDLE IN THE SNOW [0m
 
I wish I was a candle in the snow I wish I was a candle in the snow  
if I was a candle in the snow I'd warm you with my tiny glow 
I wish I was a candle in the snow  
I wish I was a string of twinkling lights I wish I was a string of twinkling lights  
if I was a string of twinkling lights I would illuminate your nights  
I wish I was a string of twinkling lights  
 
but on this Christmas eve  
you are so far away from me 
even so I hope you see my luminations 
              B7                    E 
and your loving light will shine on me  
 
I wish I was the sunrise on the frost I wish I was the sunrise on the frost 
if I was the sunrise on the frost I'd help you home when you are lost 
I wish I was the sunrise on the frost 
I wish I were the wavy northern lights I wish I were the wavy northern lights 
if I were the wavy northern lights I'd dance for you and you'd smile bright 
I wish I were the wavy northern lights
