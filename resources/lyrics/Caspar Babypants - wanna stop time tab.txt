[1mWANNA STOP TIME [0m
 
baby was born baby did cry 
baby opens up it's baby eyes for the first time 
look around take it in the world is here for you 
everything is bright and shiny everything is new 
baby goes coo baby makes a sound 
baby kicks it's legs and my baby rolls around 
napping on the couch cause there's nothing else to do 
waking up sitting up I think baby grew but 
 
  right now my baby is wee bouncing on my bended knee 
  stay small stay mine stay still 'cause I wanna stop time (2) 
na na na na na na     na na na na na na  
stay small stay mine stay still 'cause I wanna stop time 
na na na na na na     na na na na na na  
 
baby stood up baby tried to walk 
baby sat back down again baby tried to talk 
days are sliding by moon to sun and sun to moon 
I don't wanna blink 'cause it will all be over soon
