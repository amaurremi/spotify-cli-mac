[1mI'VE BEEN SLEEPY ON THE RAILROAD [0m
 
I've been sleepy on the railroad all the live long night 
I've been sleepy on the railroad just to pass the time till light 
can't you hear the whistle blowing rise up so early in the morn 
can't you hear the people shouting baby come and blow your horn 
 
baby won't you blow baby won't you blow 
baby won't you blow your horn 
baby won't you blow baby won't you blow 
baby won't you blow your horn 
 
I've been sleepy on the railroad underneath a sky so black 
I've been sleepy on the railroad hear the wheels go clickity clickity clack 
can't you see the towns we're passing shuttered since night fell 
can't you hear the people shouting baby come and ring your bell 
 
baby won't you ring baby won't you ring 
baby won't you ring your bell 
baby won't you ring baby won't you ring 
baby won't you ring your bell
