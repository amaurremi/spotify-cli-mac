[1mTURN YOUR FROWN AROUND [0m
 
if you're hungry in yer tum if you bump your baby thumb 
if you break your favorite drum (I'll be there) 
if you miss a little friend if there is a scary wind 
if the party has to end (I'll be there) 
if the night is just too long if you feel you don't belong 
if your pants are pinching wrong (I'll be there) 
 
G             Bm                   C                                    G 
I'm gonna turn your frown around (turn your frown around) 
        Bm                    C                        G 
your smile's on upside down (on upside down) 
        Bm                    C                                        D 
I'm gonna turn your frown around (turn your frown around) 
 
if you tumble take a fall if you think you've lost it all 
if your mittens are too small (I'll be there) 
if you're down and sad and blue if you don't know what to do 
if there's pebbles in your shoe (I'll be there) 
if you have a runny nose if your missed your favorite shows 
if you're simply feeling low (I'll be there)
