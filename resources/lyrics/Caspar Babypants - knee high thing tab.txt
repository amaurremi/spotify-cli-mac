[1mKNEE HIGH THING [0m
 
a bud will sprout to be tall as a tree and you will sprout to be tall like me 
so waddle through the grass so green I'll measure you against my knee 
 
you're my knee high knee high knee high thing knee high knee high knee high thing 
time flies by and you're growin' like a weed  
 
clear the prickers from our favorite spot kick back and look at the sky we got a 
flower that grows when the sun is hot through the cracks in the parking lot 
 
I'm feeling dandy like a dandelion as you toddle along by my side 
someday you may run and hide but for now you're stuck to me like a vine 
 
 
the day is over and the sun is gone the weeds are sleeping and waiting for dawn 
I sing my song and can't go wrong all you need to do is sing along   
 
you're my knee high knee high knee high thing knee high knee high knee high thing 
time flies by and you're growin' like a weed     (2)
