[1mFUZZY BUZZY BUZZING BUG [0m
 
lately everytime that I try to go to sleep 
I hear a tiny buzzy sound right above me 
I toss and I trun and I flip and I flop 
I switch on the light and the buzzy sound stops 
 
     fuzzy buzzy buzzing bug        fuzzy buzzy buzzing bug   
     fuzzy buzzy buzzing bug 
 
I put my fingers in my ears and a pillow on my head 
I sleep in the bathroom on the floor without a bed 
when I'm just about to slip into a dreamy place 
I hear that microscopic sound right beside my face 
 
so I go down to the basement to see if that will work 
I have to get away from that zippy little jerk 
dark and cold and quiet there's no sound in here 
but then there it is again right beside my ear 
 
I finally give up and start buzzing along 
the two of us harmonizing fuzzy little songs 
we both fall asleep at a quarter past three 
still humming and buzzing some sleepy melodies
