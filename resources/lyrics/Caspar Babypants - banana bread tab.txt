[1mBANANA BREAD  [0m
 
banana bread banana bread we can be banana bread 
we're not pretty but we're not dead we can be banana bread 
 
    you brought us home from the grocery we looked so snappy 
put us on the counter top over there we were so happy 
then you forgot about us lunch after lunch 
now we are a fruit fly covered brown and bummed out bunch but 
 
    once upon a time we were so yellow 
cheery bright and smiling a bunch of happy fellows 
then we got forgotten now it's almost too late 
but you can still make us into something tasty to put on your plate

    me and the boys have been together for so long 
we grew up on a banana tree and learned to sing this song 
all the young bananas learned it in case they get forgotten 
so people don't throw them out just because they look a little bit rotten
