[1mUP ALL NIGHT [0m
 
up all night up all night tree to tree look at me I'm 
up all night up all night bright and light and snowy white I'm 
up all night tonight up all night tonight 
 
you could fly and be with me 
but you might need a little more sleep 
so listen for me calling you 
 
up all night up all night out for a ride eyes open wide 
up all night up all night wind in feathers night times better so I'm 
up all night tonight up all night tonight

you could fly and be with me 
but you might need a little more sleep 
so listen for me calling you 
 
up all night up all night tree to tree look at me I'm 
up all night up all night gliding home in the sunrise glow I've been 
up all night tonight all night tonight 
all night tonight all night tonight
