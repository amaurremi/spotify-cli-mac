[1mEARLY MORNING EARLY EVENING [0m
 
now it's early morning birds all beep and sing  
happy to flap flap flap their wings 
now it's early evening flew so far and wide 
a nest is the best place to hide 
 
now it's early morning the centepedes are long 
hundreds of legs going strong 
now it's early evening the centepedes are beat 
hundreds of tiny tired feet 
 
now it's early morning clouds on mountain tops 
let go of their rainy drops 
now it's early evening clouds float home to sleep 
in the rivers lakes and streams 
 
now it's early morning flowers open wide 
fields of color burning bright 
now it's early evening pedals want to close 
time to snooze time to doze
