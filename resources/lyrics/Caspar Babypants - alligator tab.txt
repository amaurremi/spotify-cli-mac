   alligator     I know you're hungry 
   alligator      your empty tummy 
   makes you stare at me and think that I could be some food 
   alligator     don't you bite me 
   alligator      you wouldn't like me 
 
   I took a walk in the sunshine out in the woods down by the swamp 
when I heard the trees moving and I saw you lick your chops 
   maybe I'll give you my candy bar 
   maybe throw in my ice cream too 
   how 'bout this little doughnut

something else for you to chew 
 
 
   and you crawl even closer and I'm shivering in my boots 
I can see that youre staring and I might look good to you 
   maybe I'll feed you flowers 
   maybe I'll feed you one or two 
   maybe a dozen of them
