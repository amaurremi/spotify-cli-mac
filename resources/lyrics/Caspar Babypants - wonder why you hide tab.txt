[1mWONDER WHY YOU HIDE [0m
 
where do the worms go? 
why can't they stay? 
where do the snails go? 
why can't they play? 
where do the crabs go? 
why are they shy? 
where do the bats go? 
where do they fly? 
 
I like you and wonder why you hide

where do the flies go? 
will they come back? 
where do the bees go? 
will they relax? 
where do the ants go? 
why do they flee? 
where do the clams go? 
gone in the sea 
 
I like you and wonder why you hide 
 
Bm  G  A  G  F#m  Em  D
