[1mTHE LAND OF SHUSH [0m
 
livin' in the land of shush where everything is hush hush 
once this land was loud now there is no sound 
 
crows used to call and screech 
waves would crash upon the beach 
dogs would bark and wine and howl 
used to be you'd hear a midnight owl now we're 
 
cars did skid zoom and beep 
chicks did peck scratch and peep 
farms are quiet and so is town 
time to turn the volume all the way down

Bm                     G   
power down your tiny brain 
Bm                   G  
silent sounds all sound the same 
once this was a noisy place 
now that loudness is drifting out to space 'cause we're 
 
livin' in the land of shush (X4) 
                            shhhh (x4)
