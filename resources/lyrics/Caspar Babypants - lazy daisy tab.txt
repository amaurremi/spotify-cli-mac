   lazy daisy     you grow so slow 
   lit by the sunsets afterglow 
 
   lazy daisy      shady days 
   lie back and watch the purple haze 
 
   lazy daisy     nothin to do 
   tucked under a sky so wide and blue 
 
   lazy daisy     lyin' down 
   snuggle your roots deep undeground 
 
   lazy daisy     sleepytime 
   smile at the moon and close your eyes 
 
   lazy daisy     it's ok 
   feel free to release another day
