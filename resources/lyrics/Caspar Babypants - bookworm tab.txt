bookworm bookworm reads a book a day 
though the sun is out he won't come out to play 
 
I called him on a Monday morning not too late 
but he was deep into a book and would not take the bait 
I called him on a Tuesday afternoon for tea  
      Gm                                       C#7                             C  
but he was just beginning to read        the history of history 
 
I called him on a Wednesday evening just to chat 
he was reading a western while wearing a cowboy hat 
I called him on a thursday       mid afternoon 
      Gm                                      C#7                             C  
but he was going down for a nap        reading goodnight moon 
 
I called him on a friday he had a good excuse 
he was laughing too hard to talk form reading Dr. Suess 
I called him on a Saturday at the crack of dawn 
    Gm                                                 C#7                              C  
he put down the phone to finish a book        and I'm still holding on 
 
called him on a Sunday just before midnight 
     Gm                                  C#7                                  C  
but he was reading a mystery       in the dark with a little light
