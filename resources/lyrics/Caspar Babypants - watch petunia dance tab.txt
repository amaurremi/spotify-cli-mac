[1mWATCH PETUNIA DANCE [0m
 
watch petunia dance watch petunia dance 
she loves to move she's a groovy plant 
all the other flowers can't so they just 
watch petunia dance 
 
the dirt is cold and the dirt is oogie 
she wants to be free and she wants to boogie 
she sees the birds twirling overhead 
      Bm                        C                        D 
and lifts her leaves and leaves her flower bed 
 
I grew petunia from a baby seed 
she always seemend to want to wiggle free 
now she wants hip high go go boots 
Bm                          C                            D 
but she needs three pairs she has got six roots 
 
 
now free from soil and worms and being stucky 
Petunia gets to dance and she feels lucky 
 
cause today      she'll dance the night away (x8) 
 
(with all the other flowers)
