[1mANTS CAN'T DANCE [0m
 
jitterbugs boogie flies do the tango centepedes twist spiders do the mambo 
one kind of bug is too shy to try 
ants can't dance ants can't dance ants can't dance 
       
those poor ants don't know how to boogie no idea how to shake their booties 
the lady bugs all ask em but it's no no no no 
ants can't dance ants can't dance ants can't dance 
 
even though they can't they all wish they could if one might then the others ones would 
who's it gonna be to help the other ants feel free? 
ants can't dance ants can't dance ants can't dance 
 
one little ant starts to shimmy everybody knows him his name is Timmy 
he grooves and moves all over the floor and now it's not true anymore that 
ants can't dance ants can't dance  
 
Cm                      Gm           A#                F  go Timmy (3) 
 
Timmy is amazing in his bright white suit all the other ants they start to move and groove 
they dance all night and into the day and now you don't hear anyone say 
ants can't dance ants can't dance ants can't dance ants can't dance 
ants can't dance ants can't dance ants can't dance
