[1mHEDGEHOG IN THE FOG  [0m
 
hedgehog in the fog lost and oh so lonely 
you can not see the path you make your way slowly 
the mist is thick you can not see the starlight 
cross the road and watch out for the car lights 
 
you're gonna be alright  you're gonna be alright  you're gonna be alright 
 
hedgehog in the fog the owls are sounding nearer (hoo hoo hoo) 
the air is thick and the pond is like a mirror (hoo hoo hoo) 
you listen in the dark quills are sharp and ready  
hedgehog in the fog you're tremling and unsteady  
 
you're gonna be alright  you're gonna be alright  you're gonna be alright 
 
hedgehog in the fog you hear your mother calling (please come home!) 
off toward her voice you run and stumble falling (please come home!) 
you fall and fall and fall into your hedgerow  
and your mothers loving arms she will never let go 
 
you're gonna be alright  you're gonna be alright  you're gonna be alright
