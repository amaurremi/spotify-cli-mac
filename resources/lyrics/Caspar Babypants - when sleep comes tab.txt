you'll be drifting off to dreamland when sleep comes (when sleep comes) 
you'll be drifting off to dreamland when sleep comes (when sleep comes) 
listen for the distant lull of a land so wonderful 
you'll be drifting off to dreamland when sleep comes  
you'll be wearing warm pyjamas when sleep comes (when sleep comes) 
you'll be wearing warm pyjamas when sleep comes (when sleep comes) 
you'll be toasty like a lamby in your snug form fitting jammy 
you'll be wearing warm pyjamas when sleep comes  
we'll be there to shut the light out when sleep comes (when sleep comes) 
we'll be there to shut the light out when sleep comes (when sleep comes) 
still the dim glow of your night lights will protect you from the night's frights 
we'll be there to shut the light out when sleep comes  
you'll be snorin' like a tiny chainsaw when sleep comes (when sleep comes) 
you'll be snorin' like a tiny chainsaw when sleep comes (when sleep comes) 
hear that chorus of little voices making tender snorty noises 
you'll be snorin' like a tiny chainsaw when sleep comes        here it comes 
 
 
(voice only) 
everyone will rest and join you when sleep comes (when sleep comes) 
everyone will rest and join you when sleep comes (when sleep comes) 
every baby boy and girl on the dark side of the world 
everyone will rest and join you when sleep comes  
 
when sleep comes (when sleep comes) when sleep comes (when sleep comes)
