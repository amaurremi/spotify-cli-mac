[1mDROPPED MY LOLLYPOP [0m
 
I just got a lollypop as big as the sun 
I just chose that lollypop because it was the brightest one 
then I dropped my lollypop in the sand 
dropped my lollypop it slipped from my hand 
 
     I watched it fall on the beach      in a motion so slow 
     people stared in disbelief   NO! 
 
now my lollypop is starting to cry 
there there dropped lollypop please dry your sweet little eyes 
I can fix you I'll wash you in the waves 
there there dropped lollypop I need you to please be brave 
 
     watching the sand wash away       and those bright colors glow 
     will this accident ruin our day   NO! 
 
you are still my lollypop and I love you so 
will a little sand make me love you less?
