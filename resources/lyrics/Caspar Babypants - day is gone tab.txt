DAY IS GONE 
 
and the stars are shining brightly and the lights are dimming down 
and the twilight it comes nightly 
sun is off moon is on everybody knows the day is gone 
 
and the crickets are all singing and the frogs call out tonight 
that's the song this night is bringing 
sun is off moon is on everybody knows the day is gone 
 
and the rivers are done running and the mountains are all still 
and the purple sky is stunning 
sun is off moon is on everybody knows the day is gone (X2) 
 
and the houses are all silent as the colors fade to grey 
and the sky is wide and giant 
sun is off moon is on everybody knows the day is gone (X2) 
 
and the stillness is astounding does the planet spin no more? 
and the silence is announcing 
sun is off moon is on everybody knows the day is gone (X4)
