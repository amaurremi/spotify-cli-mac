[1mDRIFT OFF IN TIME [0m
 
ring ring let the bells ring out in the snow gather and sing 
gather and sing sing in the cold 
let the notes ring silver and gold 
 
ice ice sparkles outside I'm in my bed blanket for sky 
tuck in the sun kiss its hot cheek 
join the cold moon frozen in sleep frozen in sleep 
 
brr brr chill in the air planets are round window is square 
wintery wind icicles form 
embers glow so toasty and warm toasty and warm toasty and warm 
 
ahh ahh ahh ahh   ahh ahh ahh ahh 
ahh ahh ahh ahh   ahh ahh ahh ahh    ahh ahh ahh 
 
shh shh the stories are told fall into a dream that's wintery cold 
sleigh bells fade steeple bells chime 
drift off to sleep drift off in time drift off in time drift off in time 
(repeat)
