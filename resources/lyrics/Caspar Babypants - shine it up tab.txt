[1mSHINE IT UP [0m
 
if its rough make it smooth blow the dust out of the record groove 
if it's rusty oil the squeak tighten up the fawcet and stop that noisy leak  
when it's looking bad don't get mad shine it up 
 
make a mess grab a mop soak up that spill and mop up that slop 
if it's messy grab a sponge add a bit of soap to soak up all the grunge 
when it's looking bad don't get mad shine it up shine it up 
shine it up now! 
 
 
if it's ratty make it neat water brown grass 'till it's thick and green 
if its dull make it shiny crisp and new where it used to be slimey 
when it's looking bad don't get mad shine it up 
 
shine it up shine it up shine it up shine it up  
shine it up shine it up shine it up shine it up  
when it's looiking bad (oh so bad) 
when you're feeling mad (oh so mad) 
when it's looking bad don't get mad just shine it up
